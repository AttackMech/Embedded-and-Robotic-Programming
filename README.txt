Embedded/Robotic Programming

One of my favourite courses, it covers programming principles specific to robots and embedded systems. I started with the fascinating history of robots, moving on to desribe robotic features like affectors, actuators and control process. I also learned about robotic control mechanisms and emergent behaviour.

For my final project in this course, I was tasked with taking the concepts learned and creating a robot of my own. I created the AlarmBot, a robotic alarm clock designed to steer itself away from the user. It would ring an alarm at the prescribed time, then zoom off. It was designed to move away from the user and avoid obstacles using various sensors. The idea was that it would force people to get up and out of bed when the alarm goes off, instead of hitting the snooze button a million times.

You can view videos of me exploring the Arduino-equipped Sparkfun Inventor's Kit, as well as the creation of the AlarmBot on YouTube.
